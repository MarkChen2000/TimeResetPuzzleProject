This is a Unity game project that developed by myself.
This is only a simple experiencing project to improve my programing skill and practice the develope flow of Unity games.

This is a 2D platformer but player also have some special skills: time stop, time reset and time reverse.
These skills can help player to slove the puzzel of levels and reach the gaol.

The project wasn't finished, I only finished the part of player behaviour, simple stats UI, time stop and time reset function.
But the new thing about the project is that all the sprit resources in game is also drawed by myself.

The development of the project was be terminated.
